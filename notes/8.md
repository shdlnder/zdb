# Today
- Added write/load simpler struct (defined array length)
- Added array slimmer
- Attempted comptime, need to spend more time here to realign how I've used generics elsewhere
- `zig test ./src/key_value.zig`
- Like this version of the array on structs more. Same footprint, easier to work with.
- Learned about std.mem.zeroes, super neat!

## Next steps
- Continue adding file backing
  - Maybe do a mem page
- Explore basic perf testing with Zig tests
