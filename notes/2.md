# Today
- "Fix" save data size in map
  - This adds some weirdness I don't know how to do anything with yet.
- Add key_value repl fn from main
- Add basic struct for NaiveKV
  - For non repl usage
- Add test
- Fix bug with large values, truncates
- `zig test ./src/key_value.zig`
- `zig run ./src/main.zig`

## Next steps
