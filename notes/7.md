# Today
- Added write struct
- Added read from struct
- Remember to pass in the allocator for tests :)
- `zig test ./src/key_value.zig`
- Annoyed at how I implemented the struct read. Forcing the []const u8 sizing in a dedicated struct is not ideal.
- The slice back out of max size []const u8 mem was neat, glad it worked!

## Next steps
- Add file backing
- Explore basic perf testing with Zig tests
